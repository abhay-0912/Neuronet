# 🧠 Neuronet: Modular Autonomous Agent Framework

**Neuronet** is a scalable and modular Central AI System built in Python, powered by Mistral APIs. It utilizes a hierarchy of intelligent autonomous agents, each specialized in a particular domain, all coordinated by a central controller.

## 🚀 Overview

Neuronet is designed to decompose complex user objectives into manageable subtasks and intelligently distribute them to the appropriate domain-specific agents. Each agent operates independently while communicating with the central controller and, when needed, with other agents.

## 📦 Architecture

- **Central Controller**: Receives user instructions and determines strategy.
- **Specialized Agents**: Modular units acting as domain experts (e.g., research, coding, evaluation).
- **Agent Communication Layer**: Enables message passing and coordination.
- **Task Management Engine**: Breaks down objectives, routes tasks, tracks progress.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11+
- Mistral API
- LangChain (planned)
- Vector Stores (e.g., FAISS/ChromaDB)
- AsyncIO for concurrent task handling

## 🧩 Agents (Example Modules)

- **Strategy Agent**: Plans subtask execution flow.
- **Research Agent**: Gathers and summarizes information.
- **Coding Agent**: Writes or refactors code.
- **Evaluator Agent**: Reviews outputs for quality and completeness.
- **Memory Agent**: Stores context for long-running tasks.

Each agent is plug-and-play and can be swapped or extended independently.
